# Spatial Level Design 
https://www.playstarstudio.com/work/spatial-level-design-prototyping

Provided is a link to an itch.io page where every project I have been a part of for my Spatial Level
Design class resides. The main focus of this course is to build levels around game design patterns
that we create. The goal of each level is to design less around the mechanics of the level but
rather the quality of the space that the player is in.
